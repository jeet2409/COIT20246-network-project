# Network Design

## 1. Assumptions
The project scenario does not specify all operational and technical details. The following assumptions were made to support the proposed network design.

1. The headquarters of Truelec is assumed to be located in Melbourne, Australia.
2. The organisation operates multiple branch offices across Australia, and the branch office designed in this project is located in Adelaide.
3. The headquarters is assumed to support approximately 65 staff members.
4. The Adelaide branch office is assumed to support approximately 20 staff members.
5. Both headquarters and branch offices require wired and wireless network access.
6. Secure communication between headquarters and branch offices is required over the public internet.


## 2. Design Goals
The proposed network design aims to meet the current and future operational needs of Truelec. The key design goals are as follows:

- Provide a secure network infrastructure to protect organisational data and systems.
- Ensure reliable connectivity for all staff at headquarters and branch offices.
- Support both wired and wireless access for flexibility and mobility.
- Allow for future growth without major redesign of the network.
- Maintain a simple and manageable network structure using industry best practices.
